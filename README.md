# Lissajous Curve Interactive Demo


Lissajous curves are looping patterns formed by plotting two sine waves at right angles.

Some corporate logos are stylized versions of these
curves — including Meta’s and Movies Anywhere’s.

This program lets you explore them interactively: adjust parameters,
visualize musical intervals, and hear the frequency ratio.

## 🎵 Sound

Since Lissajous curves reflect the ratio between two sine waves, we can
visualize **musical intervals** — which are two notes played together.

This demo lets you hear those intervals while seeing their shape.
We use 220 Hz (A3) as the base frequency (`a = 1`). For example, a
**perfect fifth** (3:2 ratio) plays A4 (440 Hz) and E5 (~660 Hz).

So yes, you can hear what a corporate logo might sound like.
